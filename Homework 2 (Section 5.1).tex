\item Standard license plates in Virginia consist of three letters followed by four numbers.\\  A sample license plate is pictured below:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.3]{virginialicenseplate.jpg}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
\item How many license plates are available if repetition of letters and numbers is allowed AND the license plate contains
\begin{itemize}
\item exactly one C or exactly one D, but not both letters AND
\item no N's, M's, and P's AND
\item at least one 4
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\item How many license plates are available if no letters and no numbers are repeated AND the license plate
\begin{itemize}
\item does not contain vowels AND
\item the four digit number does not start with a 0 AND
\item the 4 digit number is even?
\end{itemize}


\end{enumerate}

\item In California, standard license plates consist of a single number followed by 3 letters and ending with 3 numbers.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.3]{California_license_plate.jpg}
\end{center}   
Suppose you wish to determine the number of California license plates that do not start with 0, there are no repeated letters or numbers, without vowels, and whose 3 digit number is even.  Is this answer different from your answer to question 1b?  That is, does changing the order of the letters or numbers change the number of arrangements?\\
Justify your answer.
